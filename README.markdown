# gotags

## Tags

I got tired of exuberant ctags failing on Ruby code (see
https://gist.github.com/jimweirich/5440424), so I wrote a version in
go.

Features:

* Ruby only
* Emacs TAGS file only
* Minimal command line arguments
* But it's **fast**

Detects:

* Classes and Modules
* Methods
* Constants
* attr_reader, attr_writer and attr_accessor definitions
* Aliases

## Usage:

```
$ gotags [options] file [file...]
```

Analyze all files listed in the command line. If the file is a
directory, then recursively analyze all the files in that directory.
If no files are listed, then the current directory ('.') is assumed.

Only <code>.rb</code>, <code>.rake</code> and <code>Rakefile</code>
files are actually handled, all other files are silently ignored.

**Command Line Options:**

* <code>-v</code> -- Display the version of the program and exit.
* <code>-h</code> -- Display a help message.

## Building

Make sure you have a recent installation of the Go language on your
system.  Then do the following:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/jimweirich/gotags.git
$ cd gotags
$ go install onestepback.org/gotags
$ cp bin/gotags SOMEWHERE_IN_YOUR_PATH
```
